# Super_Complementary_Code
Generating Super Complementary Orthogonal Codes for CDMA system scenarios
The super complementary codes were proposed by Prof. Chen to overcome the problems with the complete complementary codes and extended complementary codes
The super complementary codes were proposed to respond to the call for a better orthogonal complementary code. 
In this complete complementary code set, each flock consists of N element codes, and each element code has a length of N^2. 
The PG value for a Super complementary code set becomes N^2 Ã— N, which is a fairly large number compared to the code set size N. 
The most important feature of the super complementary code is that it can support much more users.
The generation approach for the super complementary codes was also developed based on the generation algorithm for the complete complementary codes in the sense that they all start with three orthogonal matrices, A, B, and D, which are always square matrices and have the same dimensions.
we can control the element code length in the generation process of an extended complementary code set. Also, it is noted that if we extend a complete complementary code set into an extended complementary code set, their set size and flock size are always unchanged but the element code length increases from N^2 to N^n. 
We use Extended Super Complementary Code for specific users and limited ones.
